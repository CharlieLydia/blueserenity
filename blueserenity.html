<p><h2>Samantha AFHT, IIHHT (MICHT), founder of Blue Serenity workplace wellness.</h2> 
 <p>I have a passion for holistic therapy and began my career by obtaining qualifications<br> 
in aromatherapy massage, reflexology, and Indian head massage. I then transitioned to<br>
 working in the police force, driven by my desire to give back to her community and help <br>
others. Combining my expertise in holistic therapy with my experience in law enforcement,<br> 
I am committed to providing a unique and effective approach to healing and wellness for my clients.<br>
<h3>The meaning behind Blue Serenity.</h3>

 reflects our vision to alleviate stress and tension, promoting peace and calmness for our clients.<br>
 Our name embodies our commitment to providing a serene and tranquil experience for everyone we serve.</p>
